Location Screen - Flutter Application

This Flutter application includes a Location Screen that enables users to track and analyze the travel patterns of individual members. The feature offers an intuitive and seamless interface for visualizing real-time locations, visited locations, and travel routes, leveraging Google Maps for precise data rendering. Designed with usability in mind, it aligns with the modern UI principles outlined in the accompanying Figma prototype.
The Location Screen serves as a powerful tool for tracking and visualizing movement data, providing users with insights like detailed travel timelines, route maps, and stop durations. It is particularly beneficial in contexts like workforce management, logistics, and field operations where tracking movement is crucial.

Overview

The Location Screen is accessible from the Attendance Menu, where a list of members is displayed. Each member has two icons:
	•	The second icon opens the Location Screen, which displays their current location and travel details.
Key functionalities include:
	•	Current Location: View real-time location on an interactive map.
	•	Timeline View: Chronological list of visited locations for today or filtered by date.
	•	Traveled Locations List: Comprehensive details of all locations visited, dynamically updated based on the selected date.
Route Screen
