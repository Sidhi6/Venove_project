Location Screen - Flutter Application

This Flutter application incorporates a Location Screen that allows users to monitor and analyze the travel patterns of individual members. Designed for intuitive navigation and usability, this feature provides a comprehensive view of current locations, visited locations, and travel routes, all seamlessly integrated with Google Maps. The UI adheres to modern design principles outlined in a Figma prototype, ensuring a sleek, user-friendly experience.
The Location Screen is a powerful tool for tracking and visualizing location data, providing users with actionable insights such as detailed travel timelines, route maps, and stop durations. This documentation outlines the functionality, features, and technical aspects of the Location Screen, serving as a guide for both developers and users.

Overview

The Location Screen is accessed via the Attendance Menu. It supports the following capabilities:
	•	Displays a list of members, each with two actionable icons for location-related functionality.
	•	Allows users to view an individual member's current location on an interactive map.
	•	Provides a detailed timeline of all locations visited by the member on a given day, with the ability to filter by specific dates for historical data.
	•	Offers a separate screen to visualize travel routes between visited locations, including details such as start and stop points, total distance traveled, and total duration.
This feature is particularly useful in contexts such as workforce management, field operations, or logistics, where tracking member movements is essential.

Features
1. Attendance Member List
The journey begins in the Attendance Menu, which presents a list of all members. Each member entry includes:
	•	Two Action Icons: 
	•	First Icon: Optional functionality (not specified).
	•	Second Icon: Opens the Location Screen, where users can view detailed travel and location data for the selected member.
This streamlined entry point makes it easy to navigate to specific member details and enhances accessibility.

2. Location Screen
The Location Screen is the center-piece of this feature, providing a snapshot of the member’s current and past locations.
Current Location
	•	Displays the member’s real-time location on an interactive map using Google Maps.
	•	The map supports standard gestures like zooming and panning for enhanced usability.
Timeline View
	•	Presents a chronological timeline of all locations visited by the member on the selected day.
	•	By default, the timeline displays today’s data, offering a quick overview of the day’s travel.
	•	A date filter allows users to view travel data from previous days, enabling historical analysis.
List of Traveled Locations
	•	Users can pull up the timeline view to access a comprehensive list of all locations visited by the member.
	•	Each entry includes key details such as the time of visit, stop duration (if applicable), and precise coordinates.
	•	This list is dynamically updated based on the selected date filter.

3. Route Screen
The Route Screen provides a deeper dive into travel data, focusing on routes between visited locations.
Route Details
	•	Start and Stop Locations: Clearly marked with pins on the map and detailed in the UI.
	•	Total Distance: Displays the total kilometers traveled between the selected points.
	•	Total Duration: Highlights the time taken to traverse the route.
Visualized Route on Map
	•	The map shows a detailed route between the two selected locations, rendered as a polyline.
	•	Red Dots for Stop Times: Stops longer than 10 minutes are marked with red dots along the route. These markers are interactive, providing additional details such as the duration of the stop.
This screen bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights, making it ideal for performance analysis or route optimization.


Design Reference

The design and layout of this feature strictly adhere to a Figma prototype, ensuring a modern, polished UI/UX. The prototype is accessible here.
Key design principles include:
	•	Clean Layouts: For clear data visualization.
	•	Interactive Maps: With support for gestures and overlays.
	•	Seamless Navigation: Between the attendance list, location screen, and route screen.
The Figma design acts as a visual guide, ensuring consistency and usability throughout the implementation.

Technologies Used
This feature leverages the following technologies and frameworks:
	•	Flutter Framework: The primary framework for building the UI, managing state, and handling navigation.
	•	Figma: For design and prototyping, ensuring adherence to modern design standards.
	•	Dart Programming Language: For developing the core application logic.
The combination of these technologies ensures a robust, performant, and visually appealing application.

Implementation Details
1. Setting Up the Project
To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone <repository-url>  
cd <repository-folder>  
flutter pub get  
2. Configuring Google Maps
Add your Google Maps API Key to the following files:
	•	AndroidManifest.xml (for Android)
	•	AppDelegate.swift (for iOS)
Ensure that the API key has permissions for Maps SDK, Directions API, and Geolocation API.
3. Running the Application
To run the app on a connected device or emulator:
flutter run  
How to Use
	•	Navigate to Attendance Menu: Launch the app and open the Attendance Menu to view the list of members.
	•	Access Location Screen: Click on the second icon next to a member’s name to open their Location Screen.
	•	Explore Timeline View:
	•	View today’s travel data by default.
	•	Use the date filter to explore historical data.
	•	View Route Details:
	•	Select two visited locations from the timeline to view the route screen.
	•	Analyze the start/stop points, total distance, duration, and stop times.

Future Enhancements
This feature has a strong foundation, but there are opportunities for further enhancements:
	•	Live Route Tracking: Incorporate real-time tracking for ongoing journeys, providing live updates on member movements.
	•	Custom Alerts: Add customizable notifications for specific events, such as stops exceeding a certain duration.
	•	Data Export: Enable users to export route and location data as PDF or CSV files for reporting and analysis.
	•	Offline Mode: Support offline viewing of historical data, making the feature more robust in low-connectivity areas.
	•	Enhanced Visualizations:
	•	Include heatmaps for frequently visited locations.
	•	Add clustering for location markers on the map.
